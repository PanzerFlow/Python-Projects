# The-Battle-of-Neighborhoods
This is my capstone project for the IBM Data Science certificate.

In this project, I learned about the following:

  - Location data and different location data providers, such as Foursquare
  - How to make RESTful API calls to the Foursquare API to retrieve data about venues in different neighborhoods around the world
  - How to be creative in situations where data are not readily available by scraping web data and parsing HTML code
  - Manipulating data through Panda
  - Generate maps of geospatial data using Folium
